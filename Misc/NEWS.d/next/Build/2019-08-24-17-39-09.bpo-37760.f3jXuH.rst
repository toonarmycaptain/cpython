The :file:`Tools/unicode/makeunicodedata.py` script, which is used for
converting information from the Unicode Character Database into generated
code and data used by the methods of :class:`str` and by the
:mod:`unicodedata` module, now handles each character's data as a
``dataclass`` with named attributes, rather than a length-18 list of
different fields.
