The logging.getLogger() API now returns the root logger when passed the name
'root', whereas previously it returned a non-root logger named 'root'. This
could affect cases where user code explicitly wants a non-root logger named
'root', or instantiates a logger using logging.getLogger(__name__) in some
top-level module called 'root.py'.
