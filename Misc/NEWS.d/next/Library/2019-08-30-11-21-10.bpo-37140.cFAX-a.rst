Fix a ctypes regression of Python 3.8. When a ctypes.Structure is passed by
copy to a function, ctypes internals created a temporary object which had
the side effect of calling the structure finalizer (__del__) twice. The
Python semantics requires a finalizer to be called exactly once. Fix ctypes
internals to no longer call the finalizer twice.
